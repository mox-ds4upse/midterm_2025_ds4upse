- **Collaboration is strictly not allowed.** Discussing, sharing, or exchanging code with others constitutes a violation of academic integrity.  
- Copy-pasting large blocks of code or using **generative AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini) **without understanding** the logic behind the code is a violation.  
- **Violations will result in a failing grade and possible disciplinary action.**
